I earned my master's degree from the [Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/). During my studies, I was a member of the [Humanoid Generalization (HuGe) lab](https://www.hugelab.org/) directed by [Beomjoon Kim](https://beomjoonkim.github.io/).

I am interested in all the things related to intelligent and dynamic movement of the robot arm including reinforcement learning, sim-to-real, robot hardware design, and perception algorithm.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree double majoring in mechanical engineering and computer science engineering from [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/).
