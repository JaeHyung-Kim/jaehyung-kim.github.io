I am a Research Engineer at [**Holiday Robotics**](https://holiday-robotics.com/), where I focus on developing intelligent robot arm manipulation. My work sits at the intersection of Sim-to-Real transfer, controlling QDD-based arm, Reinforcement Learning, and perception.

I earned my M.S. in from the [Graduate School of AI](https://gsai.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST, where I was a member of the [Humanoid Generalization (HuGe) Lab](https://www.hugelab.org/) advised by Beomjoon Kim. Previously, I completed a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science Engineering at [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr/).

I am driven by the challenge of creating dynamic, fluid robot movements that bridge the gap between simulation and the physical world.
